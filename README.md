A basic iPad app for viewing my [rtsp baby camera](https://idle.run/rtsp-raspi).

Uses the VLCKit library to do most of the heavy lifting.

Features:

* Single saved RTSP server address with automatic connect on start
* Automatic reconnect when frames stop flowing
* Pinch to zoom
* Automatic pause when not visible



## Build


## Note

This project is my first experiment in iPad app development. It should not be used as a reference for "good design and style".
